title: Mercedes W124 E320 Wagon notes
---

Here are some notes about Mercedes W124 wagon ownership in case the information
is useful to other people. Specifically my experience is with the later E320
wagon (with the DOHC m104 3.2L six).

The Mercedes W124 is a fantastic car and I highly recommend it to anyone who
can handle (and enjoys) doing basic maintenance and repairs themselves.  They
are not, however, for the faint of heart or for people who need a shop or
dealer to repair everything on the car -- these are somewhat complex cars with
a few potential issues and repairs could get expensive unless you are willing
to research and do a few things yourself, including tracking down used parts
when needed.

The E320 is solid, safe, and quite reliable. The wagon portion is really well
designed for doing wagon things:

The rear seats fold forward nicely in two sections and latch flat into the
floor, there is a removable cargo cover and cargo net system included, and
the car even
provides two rear-facing seats in the back and is technically able to seat
seven people when needed.  The included roof rack works well and is easy to
adjust.  The wagons feature a hydraulic self-levelling rear suspension that
handles heavy loads brilliantly.

The car itself drives better than the popular W123 wagon: it is much more
modern, more comfortable, and smoother. The wagon door provides a soft-close
mechanism much like the W140 S-class trunk latch, and the W124 has quite a
lot more power of course.  The later ones have very good brakes (with four
piston front calipers), ABS is standard, and a rudimentary traction control
system called ASR was an option.

All W124s have a driver side air bag and later (1994 and 1995) cars have a
front passenger side air bag.  This was added by taking away the glove box
because Mercedes did not want to redesign the dashboard for the two final
years. The center console does have a storage compartment and the front doors
have reasonable storage as well.

Keep in mind that these cars do not have particularly good fuel economy and
they do require premium (91 octane or higher) fuel. The m104 six provides about
the same fuel economy as the 4.2L m119 V8 in the E420 sedan.
It may be the sheer weight of the car plus the 4-speed automatic. Even freeway
fuel consumption is not that great.

## Our car

The W124 wagon we wound up buying is a 1994 E320 with, as it turns out, nearly
all of the options.  Some of the interesting ones include:

 * leather seats (the other option is vinyl)
 * heated front seats with memory (look for heater switches on either side of the center console ashtray)
 * adjustable steering column
 * headlight washer and wiper system
 * ASR (traction control)

All of the US-market wagons (I believe) have the power sunroof standard along
with the rear-facing fold-out seats and cargo cover system. The standard wood
trim is zebrano (zebra wood) like on the W123 but there is also an optional
burl walnut trim.

## Issues and Things to Avoid

There are a number of potential problems or weak points on the W124. They are
easy enough to deal with but it is important to be aware and ready.

### 4Matic

The W124 has the first implementation of 4Matic and it is extremely
complex and trouble-prone, plus parts to repair it are difficult to obtain.
Whether 300TE or E320, just avoid the 4Matic ones.  [This wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4Matic) explains 4Matic.

### Transmission

The 4-speed automatic in these cars is a Mercedes design and is very reliable
for an automatic. That said most used W124 cars are likely to have enough miles
on them to need a transmission rebuild. A replacement transmission runs about
$2500 at this time which, given the low cost of the car to begin with, is not
really that big of a deal. That said, you may be able to find a car that
already has a new or rebuild transmission, that is definitely a bonus. The
previous owner of our E320 had the transmission replaced at about 216k miles.

These transmissions can fail in a number of ways but a typical warning sign is
difficulty in engaging reverse: if that is happening, a transmission rebuild
is coming soon. A car with no working reverse definitely needs a transmission.

### Wiring

The W124 wagons were made during the range of years in which Mercedes had a
huge problem with wiring harness insulation.  The later-model E320 cars like
ours will absolutely have the "wiring problems" so it's important to know what
harnesses have already been replaced when looking at used cars.  There are
actually several wiring harnesses under the hood that can (and will) fail, I
think the total is four separate units if you count the throttle body.

The first one to check is the main fuel injection wiring harness.  This starts
at the ECU (behind the battery) and runs to the engine (between the valve cover
and the intake manifold), connecting to the MAF, all injectors, and various
sensors on the front of the engine.  This harness is very expensive ($1400 or
so new) but it can be replaced with a used one that was built after the wiring
insulation was improved -- the key is the date code on the harness.

The fuel injection harness date code can be found near where the harness plugs into the ECU.  To see it open the hood (all the way up via the vertical latches
helps) and remove the plastic ECU cover behind the battery (it's just stuck
into place, no fasteners).  You should hopefully see a white Delphi parts tag
with a date code much newer than the year of the car on this harness, indicating
a replacement part. A date code near the car's production date or model year
likely indicates the original part and this harness is very likely to fail
soon if it hasn't already.

Another harness connects to the alternator and starter (this actually failed
on ours) but is much harder to inspect.

Finally, these cars have a partially drive-by-wire (electric) throttle body.
The wiring in the throttle body has the same insulation problem as the fuel
injection harness and will fail. A good warning sign (and our E320 had this)
is non-functional cruise control. The throttle wiring may still fail even if
the cruise control works but a non-functional cruise control tells you that
this is likely the case.  Again this throttle can simply be replaced with one
from a newer car (Mercedes used the m104 motor for several more years), I used
one from a newer C-class with a 2003 date code to repair our 1994 E320 and it
worked perfectly.  The wiring can also be repaired via a mail-in service offered
by a couple of companies (that will run around $400 or so from what I have read). The throttle does have a date code noted on a parts sticker but it may be very
difficult to see without taking things apart.

There are two variants of the E320 throttle body (and corresponding
idle/throttle control ECU) -- one for cars with ASR and another for cars without ASR.  They are not interchangeable.

### Engine

The m104 six is considered very reliable, however they are known to have a
weakness in the head gasket and eventually may develop an oil leak toward the
back of the head. Blown head gaskets are not unheard of as well. Our E320 has
well over 226k miles on it and runs fine though (we do not have any records
indicating a rebuild or even a new head gasket but maybe it was done at some
point).

### Other Issues

The m104 motors have a less than ideal EGR tube design and these tubes can get
clogged due to a nearly 90-degree bend. I personally have not experienced this
problem but the solution is to clean the tube or replace it with a newer design
part.

Some owners install an off-brand MAF sensor while troubleshooting the car (or
when the MAF genuinely fails). These are known to be junk and indeed my car
came with some off-brand MAF that soon failed. The correct Bosch MAF is very
expensive however I was able to find a cheap used one on eBay and it works fine.

The W124 relies on vacuum to control several subsystems including the HVAC so
make sure that all the dashboard controls are working (note that the top center
vents are not used when heating, that is by design) since that system is hard
to troubleshoot. The power locks and wagon hatch lock are also vacuum-actuated.

The self-levelling rear suspension is very reliable but, when it fails, requires
a more expensive set of parts than a traditional gas shock absorber. I cannot
think of a good way to check this system beyond obvious signs of hydraulic leaks, however I am told that the rear suspension will feel rock-hard and
uncomfortable (little to no dampening) when it fails.  I did get to see ours
work in an obvious way several times but that would be hard to do on a test
drive: load the wagon with a lot of heavy things (in my case, hundreds of
pounds of tile for a bathroom remodel) and then start the car and watch the
rear end lift to the right ride height.

I have heard of W124 wagons with leaks in the wagon back area, probably from the hatch itself or one of the side windows. This can result in significant damage or rust so it's worth checking for.  Ours seems to be leak-free.

The rear wagon door hatch struts eventually fail.  Replacements aren't very
expensive and you can install them yourself with a bit of effort (not my
favorite repair job, but I got through it!) to restore operation.  The door
is very heavy otherwise.

The W124 is one of the last (if not the last) cars to use the "bullet" (rather
than "blade") fuses that were popular on German cars. There are two kinds of
"bullet" fuses: ones with a silver color contact and ones with a copper color
contact. The original silver ones are known to build up resistance and cause
circuits to act like they are open (that is, the fuse is blown but it is not
physically blown), causing all sorts of problems. All of the fuses should be
replaced with the copper ones. For example we once noticed that the power
seats and wipers stopped working: replacing the corresponding fuse solved the
problem immediately even though that (silver color contact) fuse was not
blown.
